    "## Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you will need to implement a filtering  inference task on an HMM. These are described in Section 15.2 of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denote the hidden states of the HMM by `S(t)` and the observations (evidence) by `E(t)`. In the weather problem from the HMM Tutorial, X(t) would be either sunny, rainy, or foggy, and `E(t)` is yes or no to indicate if an umbrella was observed. We will use this model with prior probabilities P(sunny) = 0.5, P(rainy) = 0.25, P(foggy) = 0.25. The remaining probilities you need are specified below in the emisssion (`P_emission`) and transition matrices (`P_transition`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you need to do\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to fill in the missing implementations of the following functions in the code where specified by the comments (`### YOUR CODE HERE ###`) and answer the questions where indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In implementing the code for the filtering task, you will be computing the probability of rain given the observations of the umbrella."
