    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The solution is in an optimal state, which denotes that the constraints have been met and the best solution has been identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best option displays the suggested inventory levels for each good to increase overall profit. The ideal inventory levels for pressure washers, go karts, generators, and water pumps are 0, 149, 231, and 116, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "A monthly profit of $137,276.25 is ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dual values and shadow prices for each constraint and variable are displayed in the sensitivity report. A constraint's dual value shows how much the ideal objective function value would rise if the constraint were eased by one unit while all other constraints remained in place. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The shadow price for a variable represents the marginal contribution of one unit of the variable to the optimal objective function value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shadow price for Inventory_Pressure_Washers is negative, indicating that a small decrease in the amount of pressure washers would not affect the optimal solution. The dual value for the Total_Warehouse_Space constraint is positive, indicating that the company could increase the warehouse space by one unit and increase the optimal objective function value by 11.16. The dual value for the Minimum_Pressure_Washers_and_Go_Karts constraint is negative, indicating that the company could decrease the minimum required inventory of pressure washers and go karts by one unit and decrease the optimal objective function value by 123.48. The dual value for the Minimum_Generators constraint is negative, indicating that the company could decrease the minimum required inventory of generators by one unit and decrease the optimal objective function value by 25.07.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the output indicates that an additional investment of USD 5,576.24 is recommended, which will increase the net monthly profit by $5,375,275.12."

    "\n",
    "The \"Total_Warehouse_Space\" restriction has a shadow price of 11.160671, according to the sensitivity report, which suggests that if the business can expand its warehouse by one square foot, it will be able to boost its monthly profit by $11.160671. As a result, I'd advise the business to hire a bigger warehouse if at all possible, provided that the cost of the bigger warehouse is less than the rise in profit from the more space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can determine that the current warehouse space needed is 25 Inventory Generators + 40 Inventory Go Karts + 25 Inventory Pressure Washers + 5 Inventory Water Pumps = 12300 square feet based on the constraint calculation presented in the sensitivity report. The shadow pricing informs us that we can raise the monthly profit by $11.160671 if we increase this by one square foot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "As a result, if the business can hire a bigger warehouse for less than $11.160671 more per square foot per month, it ought to do so. The cost of renting additional space and the amount of additional profit the company is ready to spend in will determine the optimal size of the suggested warehouse."
